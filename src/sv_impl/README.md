This is the system verilog implementation of the FPGA module that I used for comparison testing.
Using quartus, one can download the designs onto the board but a simulation of the process can be run
using the vcs tool with the -sverilog flag enabled.

Src - contains all of the component modules and inner parts
Test - contains tests for the module
Grid - Creating larber grids of trees
