        <h4> Decision Tree </h4>
        <img src = "images/design1.png" width = "500"/>
        <p> For this implementation, I will define a decision tree as a tree with s levels. Such a tree has branch nodes, at which a sample data
            is compared to a threshold and a path accordingly taken, as well as leaf nodes at which the final result is calculated and sent to the
            analysis unit.
        </p>
        <p> Laid out in memory, the decision tree can be represented as a large array of size [(5 * 2 ^ s - 2) * sizeof(data)]. There are 2 ^ s - 1
            branch nodes which each take up 2 data slots of memory. There are also 2 ^ s leaf nodes which each take up 3 data slots of memory. Our system
            is implemented such that all trees have the same number of branch and leaf nodes such that indexing into a tree in the forest is 
            straightforeward. A possible elastic modification would have an array of indices into the tree that represent where each tree starts; this system
            could allow for trees that don't uniformly branch out.
        </p>
        <p> The way that memory is laid out for a tree, the index of the left child of a node is simply (nodeIdx << 1) while the node index of the right
            child is simply (nodeIdx << 2 + 1).
        </p>

        <h4> Branch Node </h4>
        <img src = "images/design2.png" width = "500"/>
        <p> For each branch node, the input to the module will be a sample set, an index of a node in the current decision tree, the
            current decision tree, as well as a valid bit to determine if the register values are ready for comparison. First, the memory
            controller finds the node with index (treeIdx * NODES_PER_TREE + nodeIDX) and outputs the corresponding threshold and
            sample index value. The sampIdx is used to select one of the samples from the array of sample data using a mux. The output of
            this mux is compared against the threshold calue outputed by the memory controller. The result of this comparison is added to the
            shifted nodeIdx to get the appropriate child node to traverse to.
        </p>
        <p> The data pipeline is simply a system by which the data propogates to the result registers at the same time the result of the computation
            is complete. As implementation continues, I expect to get the exact number of clock cycles so I could hard code the number of register transfers
            needed to faciltate storing the new updated values as the output. However, to maintain an elastic system, I could use a series of control
            signals to manage the transfer between initial and final register states.
