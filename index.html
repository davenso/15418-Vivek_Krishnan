        <p> I plan to implement the Random Forest Classification image processing algorithm on an FPGA. I will then compare
            energy consumption and performance of the algorithm vs current CPU implementations.</p>

        <p> Heterogenous system design already is widely used in order to anticipate workloads that are more relevant to
            real world application of devices. For example, ASIC units in mobile devices today provide much of the image
            and video processing capabilities. The frequent use of these features as well as the energy and 
            performance boosts gained by using a fixed function unit outweigh the lack of functionality the ASIC unit is
            capable of performing.
        </p>
        <p> In order to fuel the trend towards computation intellegence in everyday devices, these devices must be able to
            perform basic machine learning and computer vision algorithms quickly and efficiently. Since these devices must
            constantly be aware of their surroundings, the resource drain of running these algorithms is non-trivial. Therefore,
            it makes sense to use an ASIC unit on these devices to perform common algorithms, such as the random forest
            classification.
        </p>
        <p> The FPGA is a natural testbed upon which the design for an ASIC unit can be implemented and finely tuned. Therefore,
            the platform upon which I will implement my optimized solution is the FPGA. However, for comparison I will use an
            optimized CPU solution.
