       <h3> Background </h3>
        <p> A Random Forest is an ensemble classifier using many decision tree models. The training of this algorithm involves
            taking a subset of the sample data with replacement in order to grow decision trees that have levels directly related
            to the input variables. Random Forest Classifiers are highly accurate, scale well to large datasets, and give back 
            information about variable interaction or importance as well.
        </p>
        <p> The purpose of my project is to speedup the classification part of the random forest algorithm (as opposed to the
            growth of decision trees).
        </p>

        for (sample in sample_data) {
        
            sample_result = 0;
            
            for (tree in forest) {
                local_result = 0;
                current_node = tree.base_node; //possible 0
                
                for (level < max_tree_depth) {
                 
                    node_index = NUM_NODES_PER_TREE * treeIdx + current_node
                    node_threshold = get_threshold (node_index);
                    sample_var_idx = get_corresponding_var (node_index);
                    sample_var_data = sample.getVar(sample_var_idx);

                        current_node = next_node (branchLeft);
                    //If at a leaf node in the tree
                    } else {
                        local_result = get_result (node_index);

                }
                sample_result += local_result;
            }
            
            sample_responses[sample] = process_result (sample_result);
        }

       <p> The classification algorithm above is parallelizable at both the tree level and the sample level. I plan to
           to make use of pipelining on the FPGA in order to maximize the parallelism I can get from both ends.

      <h3> Challenge </h3>
        <p> At first glance, the random forest classification algorithm may not look like it has too much to
            gain from implementation on an FPGA or hardware device. For any given given decision tree in the forest,
            travesing each level of the tree requires only one comparison compared to one lookup of the next appropriate
            state of the tree. Therefore, the computation to communication ration is inherently low in this algorithm. 
            Each decision also  requires that the decision in the previous level has already been made. 
            
            Another problem is that the many decision trees spit out by the tree-growing algorithms can greatly vary in
            size and shape so any fixed width solution (such as SIMD parallelsim) can be made inefficient by the data-
            dependent nature of the method.
            
            In addition, machine learning algorithms have to deal with increasingly larger data sets that might not be
            able to be completely stored on one FPGA memory. While, FPGAs have very fast internal memory bandwidth, they
            have limited capacity to pass data around between FPGAs.
            
            However, the algorithm is massively data parallel. The processing of a sample through each decision tree is 
            completely independent

      <h1> Resources </h1>
        <p> For this task I will be implementing the algorithm in System Verilog on an Altera Cyclone IV FPGA chip. For comparison,
            I will use a standard C++ implementation of the algorithm using libraries such as OpenMP or AVX vector intrinsics in order
            to maximize performance of the algorithm on a CPU.

       <h3> Goals </h3>
        <p> From information about current performance gains from dedicated ASIC units on image processing on bolie devices, I expect to
            be able to deliver performance gains of about one to two orders of magnitude in respect to both time and energy. I expect to 
            provide detailed charts that plot energy consumption and time consumption against dataset size.
        </p>
        <p> Overall, I hope to gain information about the possible performance benefits that can be gained from implementing
            computer vision algorithms on ASIC chips. I expect to gain information about the possible pitfalls to implementations
            on the FPGA units and how performance of the algorithm scales as the dataset increases beyond the scope of one FPGA
        </p>
        <p> A possible extension to this project is to explore performance of this algorithm on a GPU.</p>

        <h3> Platform Choice </h3>
        <p> Heterogenous system design already is widely used in order to anticipate workloads that are more relevant to
            real world application of devices. For example, ASIC units in mobile devices today provide much of the image
            and video processing capabilities. The frequent use of these features as well as the energy and 
            performance boosts gained by using a fixed function unit outweigh the lack of functionality the ASIC unit is
            capable of performing.
        </p>
        <p> In order to fuel the trend towards computation intellegence in everyday devices, these devices must be able to
            perform basic machine learning and computer vision algorithms quickly and efficiently. Since these devices must
            constantly be aware of their surroundings, the resource drain of running these algorithms is non-trivial. Therefore,
            it makes sense to use an ASIC unit on these devices to perform common algorithms, such as the random forest
            classification.
        </p>
        <p> The FPGA is a natural testbed upon which the design for an ASIC unit can be implemented and finely tuned. Therefore,
            the platform upon which I will implement my optimized solution is the FPGA. However, for comparison I will use an
            optimized CPU solution.
